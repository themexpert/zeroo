Zeroo is a minimal blog theme and boilerplate to get you started with `OnePager` plugin. Based on `_s` and inspired from `Medium`.

Demo : [Zeroo Demo](http://zeroo.getonepager.com)

##Getting Started

Download `Zeroo` from GitHub.  The first thing you want to do is copy the `zeroo` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `mytheme`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

* Search for `'_zeroo'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
* Search for `_zeroo_` to capture all the function names.
* Search for Text Domain: `tx-zero` in style.css.
* Search for `tx-zeroo` and replace
* Search for `tx_zeroo` and replace
